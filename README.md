#	Instructions



+ Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.



+ Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.
 At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.



+ Write a program that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word,
 moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
